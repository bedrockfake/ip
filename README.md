# Luke project template

This is a project template for a greenfield Java project. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Luke is currently a command-line task tracker that can store todos, deadlines, and events.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/luke/Luke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Luke.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
    _         _        
   | |  _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| |_| |   <  __/
   |_____\__,_|_|\_\___|
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location many Java tools expect to find source files.

## Running from the terminal

Run Luke from the project root:

```bash
sh run.sh
```

`run.sh` compiles all source files into the `out` folder with `javac`, then starts `Luke`.

## Running tests

This repository uses a small dependency-free Java test runner instead of JUnit. Run:

```bash
sh test.sh
```

`test.sh` compiles `src/main/java` and `src/test/java`, then runs `luke.LukeTest`.

## User guide

For supported commands and examples, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## AI assistance disclosure

Codex was used to generate the unit tests and to write most of the user
documentation and Javadocs. The generated content was reviewed and integrated
into the project by the author.
